# LiqPAY Demo application

The demo is live at http://liqpay-demo.heroku.com

The gem itself is at https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/liqpay

Things of note: [the OrdersController](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/liqpay_demo/blob/master/app/controllers/orders_controller.rb), which creates
a Liqpay request, and [the PaymentsController](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/liqpay_demo/blob/master/app/controllers/payments_controller.rb), which
processes the response.
